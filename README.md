# ChatterBot_Tutorials

This project tries to introduce about ChatterBot. It is a very useful tool to create an retrieval-based bot in python
Generally, Bot will accept an input, searching in database to find the best statement that similar to input, then will get a set of responses for that statement. Finally, it will use some methods to estimate the best response in that set

There are some small exercises to see how to work with Chatterbot
